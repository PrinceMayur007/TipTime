# TipTime
This is android app for calculating tip for cost of service taken by the user. 

Added legacy and adaptive vector icon, optimized with material design guidelines and theming (including dark mode), also added accessibility features.

You can fork and make more changes to this with adding more features or extending it. 
Thank you! ;)
